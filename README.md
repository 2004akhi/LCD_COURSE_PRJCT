# TOPIC :- UP COUNTER CIRCUIT WITH SEVEN SEGMENT DISPLAY

## This project introduces the design and implementation of an up counter circuit integrated with a seven-segment display. 
## The primary objective is to create a versatile counting system capable of visually representing numerical values from 0 to 9 using the seven-segment display.
## The circuit is constructed using standard digital logic components. 
## The counter circuit incrementally counts in a cyclic manner, triggering the seven-segment display to sequentially showcase the corresponding digits.
## A reset feature is incorporated to allow users to initiate counting from a predefined starting point.
## Light emitting diodes are added to the circuit which blinks whenever the counter or the reset button is enabled.
